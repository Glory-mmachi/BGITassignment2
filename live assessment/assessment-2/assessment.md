Bootstrap is a CSS framework from building responcsive UI which provides already made HTML,CSS and Javascript components.It provides responsive layout structures like grids, and CSS styles, simplifying and speeding up web development.
It offers a responsive grid system, pre-styled components, extensive library, and consistent CSS across browsers. Its advantages include rapid development, mobile-first approach, easy customization, and the ability to create consistent, appealing designs efficiently for web projects.

/////
Bootstrap's grid system is a responsive layout structure with 12 columns, allowing efficient design and alignment of content across various screen sizes for web development.W use it by utilizing Bootstrap's predefined grid classes like 'container', 'row', and 'col' to create a flexible and responsive layout effortlessly.

///////////
Bootstrap components are predesigned components that can be used in projects
eg: Crds,jumbothron,navbar,buttons

////////////
Variales are like boxes that stores values or data within it
Functions are reuseable piece of code that perform a specific tast and can be called upon at any point in our code
Loops are used to iterate over an iterable such as arrays

///////
var can be changed with/without the 'var' keyword

Event handling allows web developers to create interactive user experiences.Such as responding to user actions like clicks,mouesOver,keyDown etc
e.g body.addEventListener('click',function(){*console.log('Hello there)*})

We create elements by using `createElement()`, modify content/styles with properties, insert into DOM with `appendChild()`. Access, modify, remove elements; handle events using event listeners.

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is a technique used in web development to communicate with a server asynchronously without needing to reload the entire web page.AJAX enables sending and receiving data from a web server asynchronously in the background without interfering with the current page. This allows for smoother and more responsive user experiences.

/////
callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed later when a particular task is completed or when a certain condition is met. 
callbacks play a crucial role in handling asynchronous operations by allowing functions to be passed as arguments and executed once an asynchronous task completes.

Responsive web design is significant role in modern web development because it ensures that websites adapt and look good on all devicesâ€”like phones, tablets, and computers. This adaptability makes it easier for people to use websites no matter the device they're using, leading to users friendly and cost-effective development.
